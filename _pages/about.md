Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student at UCSD in the [Programming Systems](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) group, advised by [Nadia Polikarpova](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/) and [Loris D'Antoni](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ldantoni/).
My goal is to find ways to help programmers reason about and write correct code. 
To that end, my research interests are in program synthesis, program verification, and related areas.


I did my undergrad at UIUC, where I graduated with degrees in CS and Math in 2024.
While there I was advised by [Talia Ringer](https://dependenttyp.es/) as part of the Illinois Theorem Provers lab.
