Hello! I'm a second-year PhD student at UCSD in the [Programming Systems](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) group, working with [Nadia Polikarpova](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/) and [Loris D'Antoni](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ldantoni/).
My research is about improving the way people write and reason about the correctness of their code.
I work at the intersection of program synthesis, AI-assisted programming, and formal methods.


I did my undergrad at UIUC, where I graduated with degrees in CS and Math in 2024.
While there I was advised by [Talia Ringer](https://dependenttyp.es/) as part of the Illinois Theorem Provers lab.
